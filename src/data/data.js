This Simple 30-Day Challenge Will Help You Build a Daily Reading Habit  

The 5-Page Rule (Start Small)  
Commit to reading just 5 pages per day – small enough to be effortless, but powerful enough to build momentum.  

Why It Works
Overcomes mental resistance – No "I don’t have time" excuse  
Creates consistency – Easier to stick to than lofty goals  
Compounds quickly – 5 pages/day = 150 pages/month (~1-2 books)  

Your 30-Day Plan  

Week 1: Build the Routine
- Keep your book visible (bedside table, desk, or bag)  
- Pair reading with an existing habit (e.g., after coffee or before bed)  

Week 2: Track & Celebrate  
- Mark an "X" on a calendar for each day completed  
- Reward yourself after 7 days (e.g., a favorite snack or 15 min extra leisure time)  

Week 3: Level Up (Optional)
- Increase to 10 pages/day  if 5 feels too easy  
- Try different genres to keep it engaging  

Week 4: Reflect & Plan Ahead 
- Note which reading times worked best for you  
- Pick your next book in advance to maintain momentum

- Prevents small tasks from piling up and becoming overwhelming
- Helps maintain momentum throughout the day

4. Use Time-Blocking

  9-10 AM: Creative work
 10-11 AM: Meetings
11-12 PM: Administrative tasks
- Helps prevent task-switching and maintains focus

5. End Your Day with a "Shutdown Ritual"
